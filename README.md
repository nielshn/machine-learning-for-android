# Applied Machine Learning for Android - My Learning Journey üöÄ

Welcome to the repository where I document my experience from the **Applied Machine Learning for Android** course by Dicoding! This course provided me with comprehensive insights into integrating Machine Learning (ML) into Android applications, using cutting-edge tools and techniques. Here‚Äôs an overview of the topics I covered:

## üìö Course Overview

This course explored the intersection of Machine Learning and Android development, with practical implementations. Here are the key topics I learned:

### 1. **Machine Learning in Android**  
   - Explored why ML is essential for Android and studied real-world use cases.  
   - Reviewed frameworks and approaches for ML integration.  
   - **Duration**: 4 hours

### 2. **Basic Android Concepts for Machine Learning**  
   - Learned about key Android components like **Custom View**.  
   - Implemented image handling using **Camera** and **Gallery**.  
   - Integrated ML with **Web API** using **Retrofit**.  
   - **Duration**: 6 hours

### 3. **ML Kit**  
   - Implemented out-of-the-box ML features like **Text Recognition**, **Translation**, and **Barcode Scanning** using **ML Kit**.  
   - **Duration**: 7 hours

### 4. **TensorFlow Lite**  
   - Discovered and utilized custom ML models.  
   - Implemented use cases including **Image Classification**, **Object Detection**, and **Prediction**.  
   - **Duration**: 9 hours

### 5. **MediaPipe**  
   - Delved into **MediaPipe** for real-time, complex media processing.  
   - Tested models using **MediaPipe Studio**.  
   - **Duration**: 6 hours

### 6. **Firebase ML**  
   - Developed dynamic ML models with **Firebase ML** for over-the-air (OTA) updates.  
   - **Duration**: 4 hours

### 7. **Generative AI**  
   - Created advanced features using **Generative AI**, such as **Smart Reply** and **BERT Question & Answer**.  
   - Implemented these features with **ML Kit** and **TensorFlow Lite**.  
   - **Duration**: 6 hours

## üèÜ Final Project: Image Classification App  
The capstone project for this course was a machine learning-powered Android app capable of classifying images directly on the device. Key features of the app include:  
- Efficient image classification from the device‚Äôs gallery.  
- Seamless integration of custom ML models for a robust user experience.

## üöÄ Key Takeaways  
Through this course, I gained valuable knowledge in:  
- Understanding the role of ML in enhancing Android apps.  
- Practical implementation of ML features using **TensorFlow Lite**, **ML Kit**, and **MediaPipe**.  
- Leveraging **Firebase ML** for dynamic model updates.  
- Exploring **Generative AI** for creative problem-solving in Android apps.
